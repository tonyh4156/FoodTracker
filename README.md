# FoodTracker
A food tracking iOS app adapted from Apple's Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift) lessons.
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/index.html

# Introduction
Originally, the food tracking app displays a list of available meals and allows users to add, remove, or edit the meals. 
Each meal includes a name that the user enters, a photo that the user chooses from his/her photo library, and a rating 
that the user selects.
The adapted version adds support for iOS 12, and new features and improvements will be added in the near future.

# How To Install
First, clone or download the project to your computer or git repository. Next, use Xcode to build the app. Finally, plug 
your iDevice into your computer to select and install/run.
